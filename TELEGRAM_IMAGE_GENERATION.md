## 🚫 Content Restrictions

DALL-E 3 has built-in safety filters and won't generate:

- ❌ Violence or gore
- ❌ Adult/NSFW content
- ❌ Hateful imagery
- ❌ Public figures (recent)
- ❌ Copyrighted characters
- ❌ Misleading content

If your prompt violates these, you'll get an error message.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to generate image"

- **Cause**: Content policy violation or API error
- **Solution**: Rephrase your prompt, make it more general

### "No image generated"

- **Cause**: OpenAI API key missing or invalid
- **Solution**: Check your `.env` file has valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Slow generation

- **Cause**: High API demand
- **Solution**: Wait and try again, or use simpler prompts

### Rate limits

- **Cause**: Too many requests in short time
- **Solution**: Wait a minute between image generations
